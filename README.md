## For instructors

- Make sure you are using `renv` for R package version control
    - Always start your session with `renv::restore()`
    - Before commit and push, run `renv::snapshot()`
- Test **locally** with
    - `quarto preview`: live preview and continuously render on save
    - `quarto render`: one-time render; resulting main page is `_render/index.html`
- **Publish** by:
    - simply push your commits to the `main` branch, GitHub Actions should handle the rendering and publishing (desired)
    - `quarto publish gh-pages` (undesired)
- Project metadata is in `_quarto.yml`. You can control the metadata in your specific `.qmd` files with its YAML header, which will override the project metadata.
